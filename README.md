My first project - InfoCovid
This was the first project in which I participated.
It was a team project that we had to develop in 3 weeks as the final project for the course unit "Laborat√≥rio e Projeto 1".

The goal of this project was to develop a Java application that met all the necessary specifications and requirements.

This project was finished successfully.
